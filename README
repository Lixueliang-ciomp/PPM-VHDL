In this project i have implemented different intensity modulation schemes which are used in optical communication. 
VHDL code for modulator as well as demodulator block has been written for OOK, PPM, DPPM and DPIM.
These modules are generic where length of PPM, DPPM, DPIM blocks and clock frequency can be configured as desired.
I have tested the design in Xilinx Virtex 2 Pro Board. 
Simulation was done in ModelSim and graphs for different blocks can be found in ~/modem/snapshot folder.
VHDL Codes for different blocks are in ~/modem/sources folder
Explanation of different block diagram will be available on request basis.
